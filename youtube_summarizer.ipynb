This trait is inherited from a common ancestor and is shared by more than 95% of all land animals. They have a body plan consisting of a tube with two openings and complex sensory organs that give them an advantage over non-bilaterians. This allows them to move quickly and precisely, and is why they are the only animals that have conquered dry land. Additionally, their two-sided symmetry allows them to push from both sides of the body with equal force, giving them an advantage over non-bilaterians.\n\nCephalization is the process by which sensory organs have become concentrated at one end of an animal, leading to the development of a brain and well-defined head section. This has occurred in groups such as vertebrates, cephalopods, and arthropods. While bilateral symmetry is the most common body plan in the animal kingdom, there are examples of animals that have broken away from this pattern due to selective pressures. These include cross-bill birds, fish like plaice, and some species of male crab.\n\nIn conclusion, bilateral symmetry is a common body plan among animals, but exceptions are known to exist. This demonstrates that selective pressures can lead to animals adapting to different body plans in order to survive. Despite the differences, animals still share many similar features, such as the cephalization process which has allowed for the development of a brain in many species.\n\n## Chapters\n### Intro\nAnimals come in all shapes and sizes, but they all share one common trait: bilateral symmetry. This trait is shared by more than 95% of all land animals, and is inherited from a common ancestor hundreds of millions of years ago. This group of animals is known as bilaterans.\n\n## Summary\nBilaterans are a large group of animals that share the trait of bilateral symmetry, which is the mirroring of the left and right sides of the body. This trait is inherited from a common ancestor and is shared by more than 95% of all land animals.\n\n### Types of Symmetry\n\nAnimals typically have two-sided symmetry, but some animals have a different type of symmetry, such as radial symmetry, and some animals have no symmetry at all. Nidarians, such as jellyfish, sea anemones, and coral, have radial symmetry and a type of cell called a nidosite that lets them deliver a sting. Sponges have no symmetry and their shape is determined by which side of the sponge is receiving more nutrients. In the Ediacaran period, over 540 million years ago, some creatures had different forms of symmetry. Fossils of an ancient organism called Chania were found in England and a whole fossilized ecosystem of these organisms was discovered on the east coast of Canada, named the Avalon Explosion. These organisms, called rangiomorphs, looked like leaves but lived too deep in the ocean to be able to photosynthesize.\n\n### Ancient Animals\nThe Ediacaran period (555 million years ago) is known for its strange and unique organisms, such as stem animals and fractal organisms. Towards the end of the period, bilaterians (organisms with bilateral symmetry) began to appear in the fossil record. This included Spraguina, which looked like a trilobite, and Kimberella, which was thought to have lived like a slug. There was also a small worm-like animal called Ikario Warayutia, which was about the size of a grain of rice and burrowed into the sands of the ancient Australian seabed.\n\n### Bilateral Animals\nBilateral animals, which evolved during the Ediacaran period, were initially outnumbered by animals with radial symmetry or other forms of symmetry. However, during the Cambrian explosion, bilaterans became much more successful and are now the most common type of animal. This is likely due to the evolution of certain traits which opened up other evolutionary pathways and gave them an advantage over other animals.\n\n### Body Plan\nBilaterians have a body plan consisting of a tube with two openings, a mouth and an anus, connected by a digestive tract. Sensory organs have developed at the head end above the mouth, giving them a defined front end and the ability to move purposefully towards stimuli. This gives them an advantage over non-bilaterians, who mostly use lures or drift through the ocean waiting for food. Box jellyfish are an exception, actively hunting fish, but they are slower than bilaterians.\n\n### Movement\nBilaterians have complex sensory organs and purposeful precise movements, which helps them move faster and more efficiently than non-bilaterians. This is due to their two-sided symmetry, which allows them to push from both sides of the body with equal force. This is why bilaterians are the only animals that have conquered dry land, as a good stable body shape is more important when out of the water.\n\n### Cephalization\nCephalization is the process where sensory organs have become more concentrated at one end of an animal over time. This process has led to the development of a brain and a well-defined head section in different animal groups such as vertebrates, cephalopods, and arthropods. Although symmetry offers many advantages, there are times when animals have evolved to break their symmetry. Examples of this include cross-bill birds, which have a beak that doesn't meet in the middle to help them access pine cone seeds, fish like plaice which orientate their body on its side to hide on the sea floor, and some species of male crab which have one claw larger than the other.\n\n### Conclusion\nBilateral symmetry is a common body plan among animals, but there are exceptions. Starfish and sea urchins, for example, appear to be radial life forms, but are actually bilaterians. This shows that selective pressures can lead to animals adapting to different body plans in order to survive. Despite the differences, animals still share a lot of similarities.\n\n"

      "Animals range drastically in size, shape, and biology, but they all share one thing: bilateral symmetry. This type of symmetry, where the left and right sides of the body are mirror images of each other, is found in more than 95% of all known land animals and is a result of an incredibly ancient common ancestor. Outside of the bilaterian group are the nidarians, which have radial symmetry and include jellyfish, sea anemones, and coral. Sponges have no symmetry at all and are multiple-celled organisms. During the Ediacaran period, some creatures had different forms of symmetry, including fractal symmetries. The Ediacaran was also home to the earliest bilaterians, such as Spraguina and Kimberella. During the Cambrian explosion, the bilaterians became much more successful and today they are by far the most common type of animal. This is likely due to the structure of the bilaterian body and lifestyle, which makes certain evolutionary pathways more likely. bilateral body plan has encouraged the evolution of other traits down the line that have given them an advantage over animals with other forms of symmetry. In its simplest form, the body plan of a bilaterian is a tube with two openings, a mouth and an anus, connected by a digestive tract. Over time, sensory organs have developed at the head end above the mouth, giving them a body plan with a defined front end that allows for purposeful movement. This gives them a big advantage over non-bilaterians, who mostly use lures or drift through the ocean waiting for food to come to them. Additionally, two-sided symmetry is a good shape for moving, as it offers a platform to have an equal set of limbs or fins on both sides of the body, allowing them to propel forward in a straight line and with more stability. This may also be the reason why bilaterians are the only animals that have conquered dry land, as gravity only becomes less forgiving and a stable body shape becomes more important. Bilateral body plans have also caused these animals to become more intelligent, as the sensory organs have trended to become more concentrated at one end of the animal over time, creating a well-defined head section and sophisticated brain in multiple bilateral groups. Although symmetry offers many advantages, there are times it can get in the way of a specific lifestyle, as there are many examples of animals that have evolved to break their symmetry. For example, crossbill birds have a beak that doesn't meet in the middle, and some species of fish like plaice have made the extreme adaptation of orientating their entire body on its side. Additionally, some species of male crab have one claw larger than the other, which can sometimes be so large that it makes up half of their body weight. Although these animals are still largely bilateral, they have the odd feature that breaks the trend of the rest of the body. Starfish and sea urchins may look like radial life, but they are actually bilaterians. At the larvae stage, these animals have a clearly defined head, although as adults they appear radial. Having two-sided symmetry isn't always the best way to survive for every animal, but the bilateral body plan shows that we are often more similar to even the most distantly related animals than we may think.\n",

      "Bilaterians are animals that have two-sided symmetry, which is the most common type of symmetry found in animals. This symmetry is believed to have been inherited from a common ancestor hundreds of millions of years ago. Bilateral symmetry allows for a more stable body shape, which is beneficial for movement and conquering dry land. Additionally, it allows for the development of more complex sensory organs and purposeful movement. Bilateral animals are by far the most common type of animals, and their success can be attributed to their body plan and movement capabilities. The trend of cephalization, where sensory organs and nerves become concentrated on one side of the body, has allowed for the development of brains and heads which have enabled animals to interact with their environment in more complex ways. However, some animals have broken away from bilateral symmetry in order to adapt to different lifestyles. Examples of this include cross-bill birds which have beaks that don’t meet in the middle, plaice which can orientate their entire body on its side, and male crabs with one claw that is larger than the other. Despite the advantages of symmetry, it is not always the best way to survive. \n",

      "In conclusion, symmetry is a common trait among animals, but some have adapted to break away from the traditional bilateral body plan to survive in different environments.
